# Changelog

What has changed in this template, and what a vault made from it has to do about each change.

Every entry carries an **Adopting this** note. That note is the only part of a release that can
carry a *semantic* change, because `vault-update.sh` moves bytes and cannot know that the `TIERS=`
line you customized inside `vault-check.sh` (see [`docs/customizing.md` §2](docs/customizing.md))
now needs a seventh entry. When a release needs nothing from you, the note says so in as many words,
because "nothing to do" and "nobody wrote the note" look identical otherwise.

**Apply the notes in release order.** A vault three releases behind applies three notes, oldest
first. A note may undo something an earlier note asked for, and reading them out of order gives a
result neither of them intended.

How to see where you stand, and what moved:

```bash
bash .claude/scripts/vault-update.sh --status
# then fetch a newer copy yourself, and compare against it
git clone https://github.com/<owner>/claude-memory-vault.git ../template-new
bash .claude/scripts/vault-update.sh --check --from ../template-new
```

[`docs/updating.md`](docs/updating.md) explains both, and says what they do not protect against.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-09-21

The first version with a version. Everything before this shipped unnumbered, so a vault created
earlier has no record of where it came from.

### Added

- `VERSION`, a single line naming the template version.
- `CHANGELOG.md`, this file.
- `.claude/manifest-rules`, which decides for every tracked file whether the template owns it,
  hands it over, or keeps it to itself. It has no catch-all rule, so a new file cannot enter the
  template without somebody deciding what happens to it in your vault.
- `.claude/template-manifest`, generated from those rules. It records the class and the SHA-256 of
  every file the template ships, and it is what lets a vault answer "what have I changed" with no
  network, no git and no second copy of the template.
- `.claude/scripts/vault-update.sh`, with `--status`, `--check`, `--diff`, `--adopt`,
  `--generate` and `--verify-manifest`.
- `docs/updating.md`.
- One report-only line in `vault-check.sh` naming the template version this vault records.

### Changed

- `.gitattributes` now pins the catch-all to `eol=lf`. Without it, files named by no specific rule
  check out with carriage returns on Windows, and a hash of their bytes would depend on which
  platform took it.

### Adopting this

**Nothing, if your vault was created from this version or later.** You already have the manifest.

**If your vault predates this release**, it has no manifest, so `--status` cannot tell you anything.
1.0.0 is the first version that ships one, so 1.0.0 is the only thing there is to adopt against.
Fetch a copy yourself and record a baseline once:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<owner>/claude-memory-vault.git ../template-new
bash .claude/scripts/vault-update.sh --adopt --from ../template-new
```

Read what it prints. Adopting records the template's hashes as your starting point, so **any
template file you had already changed is recorded as though the template shipped it that way**, and
it will read as untouched from then on. Nothing recovers that — the hashes were never written down.
Treat the first `--check` report as a starting point rather than a verdict.

From the next release onward the advice changes, because there will then be older releases to choose
between: adopt against the oldest one you might plausibly have started from, so the tool
over-reports what you changed rather than under-reporting it.
