# Control suite for this vault's hooks and checkers.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS SHAPED THIS WAY:
# Every check in here has BOTH a positive and a negative control. A lint hook
# that silently does nothing produces exactly the same output as a lint hook
# that found nothing wrong - "clean" and "did not run" are indistinguishable
# unless you first prove the instrument can detect a known-bad input.
#
# That is not a hypothetical. The invisible-character scan in vault-lint.sh
# relies on `grep -P`, a GNU extension that BSD grep (macOS) does not have; the
# original version redirected its error to /dev/null and reported every file
# clean on a Mac. The hook now prefers perl and warns when neither tool exists,
# and the positive controls below are what keep that honest.
#
# Usage:  bash .claude/scripts/run-tests.sh
# Exit:   0 = all controls passed, 1 = at least one failed.
# Writes: nothing outside a temporary directory, which is removed on exit.
